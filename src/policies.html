To paraphrase the butler in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiZ8D9akdV4">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>, this is a law firm, and we have many rules. Fortunately they make a lot of sense, and you probably already intuitively know how a law firm, attorneys, and attorneys' staff members should act. Basically, it's "Do the right thing."

To learnÂ specifics of what that means in different situations, you can read our policies here.

Oh, the one real important thing that may not be real intuitive: reading something on this web site does not mean that you have an attorney representing you and giving you legal advice. We will always send an engagement letter to a new client. This letter is the only way we agree to be your attorney. Ever.

Here are the policies that we live by:
