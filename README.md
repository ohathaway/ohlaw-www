# This is the webpage for OHLaw
The intent is to create a single file, high-speed front page and associated landing pages consistent with the Wordpress versions of the page that currently exist.

Dynamic content is to continue to be handled by Wordpress, but I need to get all the WP code out of the way to make a clean, fast version of the page for SEO.
